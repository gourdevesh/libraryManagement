Library Management System
Overview
The Library Management System is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This system allows users to manage library books and track the borrowing and returning of books. The UI is designed to be responsive, using Material UI, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

Key Features
User Authentication

Implemented with JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication.
Users can register, log in, and log out.
Upon successful login, users receive a JWT token for subsequent requests.

The admin panel displays options to add, edit, delete books, and view borrowed book lists.
User Registration and Login

New users register by providing necessary details.
After registration, users can log in using their credentials.

Borrowing and Returning Books

Logged-in users can view available books on the home page.
Users can borrow books, and the borrowed book details are updated in the system.
Users can return books, marking them as available again in the system.

Users can log out, which invalidates their JWT token and redirects them to the login page.
Technical Implementation
Backend (Node.js + Express.js)

Setup an Express server with RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, book management, and borrowing/returning books.
Use MongoDB to store user data, book details, and borrowing records.
Implement JWT for secure user authentication.
Frontend (React)

Use React for building the user interface.
Utilize Material UI components for a responsive and visually appealing design.
Manage state using React hooks and context API.
Handle user authentication, book management, and borrowing/returning books through API calls to the backend.
Conclusion
This Library Management System offers a comprehensive solution for managing library books and tracking their borrowing and returning. By leveraging the MERN stack and Material UI, the system ensures a robust, secure, and responsive user experience.
